# spa #

The `spa` application is a Python utility that generates simple animations
using a variety of image processing techniques.

## Install ##

Run the following commands in order to install all third-party dependencies:

1. `sudo apt-get install pip virtualenv`: Install library management utilities for Python.
1. `virtualenv venv`: Create a virtual environment for all of the Python dependencies.
1. `source venv/bin/activate`: Activate the virtual environment to install dependencies locally.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`: Install all Python dependencies into the local virtual environment.

## Create ##

Any image manipulation software can be used to generate images for use by `spa`,
but the following applications were used to generate the contained examples:

- [`GIMP`][gimp]: An open-source image manipulation tool that supports layering.
- [`gimp-export-layers`][gimp-el]: An extension for `GIMP` that allows layers to be
  output as separate images (used to transform XCF files into individual PNGs).

## Publish ##

The videos generated by this application cannot be published to many social
media websites by default. In order to hammer these videos into the correct
format, use the video converter found [here](https://www.ofoct.com/video-converter/convert-to-h-264-video.html).
